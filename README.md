Lego Line in LDraw
==================

This repository contains LDraw files for the lego line. To view and edit these files, you'll want
to run the [All In One Installer](http://www.ldraw.org/article/104.html).

Editing tips
------------

These files were produced using a [custom version of LeoCAD](http://github.com/eric-wieser/leocad).
This doesn't mean they can't be edited in any other ldraw editor, such as MLCAD.

New modules should have their baseplate center at the horizontal origin.

All technic parts should be aligned to a half stud coordinate. This causes the baseplate not to line up at Y=0, but that is OK.

Add steps to models where possible
